My Web Programming 1 project is a successor to the game I made in Programming 1, RNG HELL.
This version of the game will not be a direct port. Some elements will carry over, while others will be changed.
My ultimate goals for this project are to meet all the requirements and produce a better game than I did in Programming 1.

More detailed objectives can be found below:


Obstacles that bounce off walls (no enemy shooting)

Online mode with rollback and lag :)
(Update: Rollback affects enemies only to allow their deaths to not count. Lag will be done by timing out the player's movement and/or changing the framerate with RNG)
SELECTABLE easy mode
allow player to choose attack direction
Bring back shields and -1 HP in some way
Bring back warping

(Update: All elements above will be implemented, but the online mode will be done entirely with RNG. No real online)

Make it possible to ensure your score is not deleted, and make it possible to reduce your odds of walk death
3 Items to fulfill the above and preserve the original
(Update: There will be one item that does both effects or screws you up with a luck stat. 
(Update: Speed is unnecessary in this version as diagonal movement is fast enough)

Speed up obstacles at intervals (based on the player's score or enemies killed)

Status effects upon getting hit? Random moving, damage for moving unless you warp, OHKO etc 
(Update: Will probably get cut since I want to prioritize bringing back the shield and the old OHKO elements with the luck stat included to give the player more "control")

Add sound effects and maybe music.

My Web Programming 1 project is a successor to the game I made in Programming 1, RNG HELL.
This version of the game will not be a direct port. Some elements will carry over, while others will be changed.
My ultimate goals for this project are to meet all the requirements and produce a better game than I did in Programming 1.

More detailed personal objectives can be found below:

Obstacles that bounce off walls (no enemy shooting)

Online mode with rollback and lag made possible with RNG :)
(Rollback affects enemies only to allow their deaths to not count. Lag will be done by timing out the player's movement and/or changing the framerate with RNG)
SELECTABLE easy mode
allow player to choose attack direction
Bring back shields and -1 HP in some way
Bring back warping
Add sound effects for various contexts. The sound effects should be meme sounds that won't age horribly.

Make it possible to ensure your score is not deleted, and make it possible to reduce your odds of walk death
Situations like the ones above will be resolved with a luck stat and an item that can alter the luck stat. 
Walk death will be replaced by potentially being OHKOed every second

Increase the difficulty as the game progresses.
This is done by never removing obstacles and corrupting the player's obstacles to the enemy's side rather than with a speed change.

Status effects upon getting hit? Random moving, damage for moving unless you warp, OHKO etc 
(The above is largely cut since I want to prioritize bringing back the shield and the old OHKO elements with the luck stat included to give the player more "control")

            Developed by Palmarino DiMarco to extract your sanity, or whatever is left of it if you played the first game. Available since December 2020<br>
            Special Thanks to Helen Katalifos for helping me develop the game along with everyone who playtested and gave me advice for various elements of the game.

        <div id="instructions">
            <h2 class="screen-title">THE BASICS</h2>
            <p class="instruction">
                When the game begins, your <img class="tutorial-image" src="../assets/images/Player.png"></img> character will spawn in the center of the screen surrounded by <img class="tutorial-image" src="../assets/images/Enemy.png"></img> enemies and <img class="tutorial-image" src="../assets/images/OpposingObstacle.png"></img> opposing obstacles. <br>
                In order to win this game, you must use random attacks to kill every last one of the enemies while avoiding the opposing obstacles. <br>
                If you lose all your HP or get OHKOed, you will lose the game. <br>
                You will not survive in this game without a good amount of luck. Touching the <img class="tutorial-image" src="../assets/images/Item.png"></img> items around the map may increase your luck if you need more.
            </p>

            <h2 class="screen-title">THE CONTROLS</h2>
            <p class="instruction">
                It's recommended that you try to forget the controls of the first game to avoid muscle memory issues. <br>
                The arrow keys are used to move. In this release you can even move diagonally! <br>
                Use the W A S D keys for attacking. More will be explained about them in the attack section. <br>
                Press Z or the Spacebar to warp to a random space. You'll need luck for the warp to be successful... <br>
                Press Escape to commit die.
            </p>

            <h2 class="screen-title">ATTACKS</h2>
            <p class="instruction">
                There are 4 attacks in this game, with the one you use being randomly selected whenever you attack. <br>
                Enemies have a 50% chance of dodging your attacks. <br>
                <br>
                The first attack is a <img class="tutorial-image" src="../assets/images/MeleeAttack.png"></img> Melee attack. It has a 50% chance of triggering and can be used to destroy <img class="tutorial-image" src="../assets/images/Item.png"></img> items or <img class="tutorial-image" src="../assets/images/Enemy.png"></img> enemies. <br>
                The key you enter when attacking decides the direction of the melee attack. W sends it up, A sends it left, S sends it down and D sends it right.<br>
                <br>
                The second attack is a <img class="tutorial-image" src="../assets/images/SupportingObstacle.png"></img> Range attack. It has a 30% chance of triggering and will spawn a supporting obstacle. <br>
                The supporting obstacle's spawning location and direction will be completely random, and it will turn to the enemy's side if it hits an <img class="tutorial-image" src="../assets/images/OpposingObstacle.png"></img> opposing obstacle or an <img class="tutorial-image" src="../assets/images/Enemy.png"></img> enemy dodges it. <br>
                <br>
                The third attack is a Shield. It has a 10% chance of triggering and causes your character to look like this <img class="tutorial-image" src="../assets/images/ShieldedPlayer.png"></img> <br>
                Shields last for a short time, but they make you impervious to <img class="tutorial-image" src="../assets/images/OpposingObstacle.png"></img> opposing obstacles while they last. <br>
                <br>
                The fourth attack is a mystery. It has a 10% chance of triggering and it... does a thing.
            </p>

            <h2 class="screen-title">TIPS</h2>
            <p class="instruction">
                In this game, elements can only interact if they have the same shape. <br>
                If you get a shield while you already have one, the countdown for your shield expiring will reset. <br>
                If you do not have a shield, the colour of your circle will depend on your HP <br>
                Whenever you are hit, you will be warped to a random space. You may get comboed from this if you're unlucky. <br>
                Taking your time is incredibly cringe, so you may lose a point for each second that passes. <br>
                This game was mainly playtested on Firefox, so try switching to it if you have problems running the game <br>
                Raise the volume and wear headphones to enhance your RNG HELL Online experience, or lower the volume if you're a casual who prefers to keep their hearing.
